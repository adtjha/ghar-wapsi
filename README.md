# Ghar Wapsi.
A project that I started in order to group people who want to travel in herd and cut their travelling cost.

## What does it do Specifically ?
- It is a web-application, wherein Users can signup by providing some travel data,
- then their data is stored onto firebase database,
- and they are provided logi details,
- when a herd is formed, and 20 people have signed up with similar travel data,
- now they can pay travel, and book tickets in bulk, which will in turn be cheaper if they would have been travelling single.

## Ui/Ux
- Design and User experience have been developed by myself, and all the animations that you see were specifically developed for this project.

## Tech Stack.
- React Js.
- Firebase as Backend Services Provider.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn add`

Installs all the necessary dependencies.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
